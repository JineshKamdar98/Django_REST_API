It is a Django REST API which is made by using Django REST Framework. It handles all the CRUD (create, read, update & delete) operations.

It uses only one endpoint which handles all the CRUD operations. We don't have to specify different urls for each operations like create, update or delete.

Here, the project name is "restapi" and the the application name is "status".

Here, I uploaded two files that is "shell_examples.py" and "restapi.py" from which I have tested my REST API. So it will be beneficial for testing purpose.

Thank you,
